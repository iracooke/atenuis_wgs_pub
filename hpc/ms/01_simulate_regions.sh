# Our goal here is to simulate large enough genomic regions to capture typical sweeps. We use 1Mb as our region size

# We need to incorporate recombination and assume a rate of 1e-8 per base

# Mutation rate is set to 2.9e-8 which was obtained from Mao et al
#
# We generate samples of 30 individuals which corresponds to our population sizes
#
# Ne is set to 50000 in accordance with estimates from MSMC
