  abstract = "Reef-building corals provide the structural basis for one of
              Earth's most spectacular and diverse-but increasingly
              threatened-ecosystems. Modern Indo-Pacific reefs are dominated by
              species of the staghorn coral genus Acropora, but the
              evolutionary and ecological factors associated with their
              diversification and rise to dominance are unclear. Recent work on
              evolutionary radiations has demonstrated the importance of
              introgression and ecological opportunity in promoting
              diversification and ecological success. Here, we analyze the
              genomes of five staghorn coral species to examine the roles of
              introgression and ecological opportunity in the rise to dominance
              of Acropora. We found evidence for a history marked by a major
              introgression event as well as recurrent gene flow across
              species. In addition, we found that genes with topologies
              mismatching the species tree are evolving faster, which is
              suggestive of a role for introgression in spreading adaptive
              genetic variation. Demographic analysis showed that Acropora
              lineages profited from climate-driven mass extinctions in the
              Plio-Pleistocene, indicating that Acropora exploited ecological
              opportunity opened by a new climatic regime favoring species that
              could cope with rapid sea-level changes. Collectively, the
              genomes of reef-building corals have recorded an evolutionary
              history shaped by introgression and climate change, suggesting
              that Acropora-among most vulnerable corals to stressors-may be
              critical for understanding how reefs track the impending rapid
              sea-level changes of the Anthropocene.",
