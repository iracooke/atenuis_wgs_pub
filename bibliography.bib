  abstract = "Despite the enormous ecological and economic importance of coral
              reefs, the keystone organisms in their establishment, the
              scleractinian corals, increasingly face a range of anthropogenic
              challenges including ocean acidification and seawater temperature
              rise. To understand better the molecular mechanisms underlying
              coral biology, here we decoded the approximately 420-megabase
              genome of Acropora digitifera using next-generation sequencing
              technology. This genome contains approximately 23,700 gene
              models. Molecular phylogenetics indicate that the coral and the
              sea anemone Nematostella vectensis diverged approximately 500
              million years ago, considerably earlier than the time over which
              modern corals are represented in the fossil record (âˆ¼240 million
              years ago). Despite the long evolutionary history of the
              endosymbiosis, no evidence was found for horizontal transfer of
              genes from symbiont to host. However, unlike several other
              corals, Acropora seems to lack an enzyme essential for cysteine
              biosynthesis, implying dependency of this coral on its symbionts
              for this amino acid. Corals inhabit environments where they are
              frequently exposed to high levels of solar radiation, and
              analysis of the Acropora genome data indicates that the coral
              host can independently carry out de novo synthesis of
              mycosporine-like amino acids, which are potent
              ultraviolet-protective compounds. In addition, the coral innate
              immunity repertoire is notably more complex than that of the sea
              anemone, indicating that some of these genes may have roles in
              symbiosis or coloniality. A number of genes with putative roles
              in calcification were identified, and several of these are
              restricted to corals. The coral genome provides a platform for
              understanding the molecular basis of symbiosis and responses to
              environmental changes.",

              efficient implementations are needed in order to facilitate
              analyses of thousands of samples simultaneously. RESULTS: We
              present a multithreaded program suite called ANGSD. This program
              can calculate various summary statistics, and perform association
              mapping and population genetic analyses utilizing the full
              information in next generation sequencing data by working
              directly on the raw sequencing data or by using genotype
              likelihoods. CONCLUSIONS: The open source c/c++ program ANGSD is
              available at http://www.popgen.dk/angsd . The program is tested
              and validated on GNU/Linux systems. The program facilitates
              multiple input formats including BAM and imputed beagle genotype

              combinations of existing methods and can perform analysis that is
              not implemented elsewhere.",

  abstract = "The accumulation of biodiversity in tropical forests can occur
              through multiple allopatric and parapatric models of
              diversification, including forest refugia, riverine barriers and
              ecological gradients. Considerable debate surrounds the major
              diversification process, particularly in the West African Lower
              Guinea forests, which contain a complex geographic arrangement of
              topographic features and historical refugia. We used genomic data
              to investigate alternative mechanisms of diversification in the
              Gaboon forest frog, Scotobleps gabonicus, by first identifying
              population structure and then performing demographic model
              selection and spatially explicit analyses. We found that a
              majority of population divergences are best explained by
              allopatric models consistent with the forest refugia hypothesis
              and involve divergence in isolation with subsequent expansion and
              gene flow. These population divergences occurred simultaneously
              and conform to predictions based on climatically stable regions
              inferred through ecological niche modelling. Although forest
              refugia played a prominent role in the intraspecific
              diversification of S. gabonicus, we also find evidence for
              potential interactions between landscape features and historical
              refugia, including major rivers and elevational barriers such as
              the Cameroonian Volcanic Line. We outline the advantages of using
              genomewide variation in a model-testing framework to distinguish
              between alternative allopatric hypotheses, and the pitfalls of
              limited geographic and molecular sampling. Although
              phylogeographic patterns are often species-specific and related
              to life-history traits, additional comparative studies
              incorporating genomic data are necessary for separating shared
              historical processes from idiosyncratic responses to
              environmental, climatic and geological influences on

              Dominance of Acropora Corals",

  abstract = "Reef-building corals provide the structural basis for one of
              Earth's most spectacular and diverse-but increasingly
              threatened-ecosystems. Modern Indo-Pacific reefs are dominated by
              species of the staghorn coral genus Acropora, but the
              evolutionary and ecological factors associated with their
              diversification and rise to dominance are unclear. Recent work on
              evolutionary radiations has demonstrated the importance of
              introgression and ecological opportunity in promoting
              diversification and ecological success. Here, we analyze the
              genomes of five staghorn coral species to examine the roles of
              introgression and ecological opportunity in the rise to dominance
              of Acropora. We found evidence for a history marked by a major
              introgression event as well as recurrent gene flow across
              species. In addition, we found that genes with topologies
              mismatching the species tree are evolving faster, which is
              suggestive of a role for introgression in spreading adaptive
              genetic variation. Demographic analysis showed that Acropora
              lineages profited from climate-driven mass extinctions in the
              Plio-Pleistocene, indicating that Acropora exploited ecological
              opportunity opened by a new climatic regime favoring species that
              could cope with rapid sea-level changes. Collectively, the
              genomes of reef-building corals have recorded an evolutionary
              history shaped by introgression and climate change, suggesting
              that Acropora-among most vulnerable corals to stressors-may be
              critical for understanding how reefs track the impending rapid
              sea-level changes of the Anthropocene.",
