  abstract = "We present here a framework for the study of molecular variation
              within a single species. Information on DNA haplotype divergence
              is incorporated into an analysis of variance format, derived from
              a matrix of squared-distances among all pairs of haplotypes. This
              analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) produces estimates of
              variance components and F-statistic analogs, designated here as
              phi-statistics, reflecting the correlation of haplotypic
              diversity at different levels of hierarchical subdivision. The
              method is flexible enough to accommodate several alternative
              input matrices, corresponding to different types of molecular
              data, as well as different types of evolutionary assumptions,
              without modifying the basic structure of the analysis. The
              significance of the variance components and phi-statistics is
              tested using a permutational approach, eliminating the normality
              assumption that is conventional for analysis of variance but
              inappropriate for molecular data. Application of AMOVA to human
              mitochondrial DNA haplotype data shows that population
              subdivisions are better resolved when some measure of molecular
              differences among haplotypes is introduced into the analysis. At
              the intraspecific level, however, the additional information
              provided by knowing the exact phylogenetic relations among
              haplotypes or by a nonlinear translation of restriction-site
              change into nucleotide diversity does not significantly modify
              the inferred population genetic structure. Monte Carlo studies
              show that site sampling does not fundamentally affect the
              significance of the molecular variance components. The AMOVA
              treatment is easily extended in several different directions and
              it constitutes a coherent and flexible framework for the
              statistical analysis of molecular data.",

              graphical capabilities of R are used for plotting haplotype

              the need to further develop an integrated-modular approach for

              analyzing data from clonal populations, making analysis difficult

              tools for analysis of data from admixed, clonal, mixed, and/or
              sexual populations. Currently, poppr can be used for
              dominant/codominant and haploid/diploid genetic data. Data can be
              imported from several formats including GenAlEx formatted text
              files and can be analyzed on a user-defined hierarchy that
              includes unlimited levels of subpopulation structure and clone

              for microsatellites, batch-analysis of the index of association

              including dendrograms with bootstrap support and minimum spanning

              censoring are specific for clonal populations, several functions
              found in poppr are also valuable to analysis of any populations.

              This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological
              interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological
              processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the
              statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups,
              e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that
              increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating
              knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the
              calculation of the statistical significance. RESULTS: We present
              two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the
              underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on
              real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both
              methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point
              to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with
              state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A
              simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a

              reefs, the keystone organisms in their establishment, the
              scleractinian corals, increasingly face a range of anthropogenic
              challenges including ocean acidification and seawater temperature
              rise. To understand better the molecular mechanisms underlying
              coral biology, here we decoded the approximately 420-megabase
              genome of Acropora digitifera using next-generation sequencing
              technology. This genome contains approximately 23,700 gene
              models. Molecular phylogenetics indicate that the coral and the
              sea anemone Nematostella vectensis diverged approximately 500
              million years ago, considerably earlier than the time over which
              modern corals are represented in the fossil record (âˆ¼240 million
              years ago). Despite the long evolutionary history of the
              endosymbiosis, no evidence was found for horizontal transfer of
              genes from symbiont to host. However, unlike several other
              corals, Acropora seems to lack an enzyme essential for cysteine
              biosynthesis, implying dependency of this coral on its symbionts
              for this amino acid. Corals inhabit environments where they are
              frequently exposed to high levels of solar radiation, and
              analysis of the Acropora genome data indicates that the coral
              host can independently carry out de novo synthesis of
              mycosporine-like amino acids, which are potent
              ultraviolet-protective compounds. In addition, the coral innate
              immunity repertoire is notably more complex than that of the sea
              anemone, indicating that some of these genes may have roles in
              symbiosis or coloniality. A number of genes with putative roles
              in calcification were identified, and several of these are
              restricted to corals. The coral genome provides a platform for

              threatened-ecosystems. Modern Indo-Pacific reefs are dominated by
              species of the staghorn coral genus Acropora, but the
              evolutionary and ecological factors associated with their
              diversification and rise to dominance are unclear. Recent work on
              evolutionary radiations has demonstrated the importance of
              introgression and ecological opportunity in promoting
              diversification and ecological success. Here, we analyze the

              introgression and ecological opportunity in the rise to dominance
              of Acropora. We found evidence for a history marked by a major
              introgression event as well as recurrent gene flow across
              species. In addition, we found that genes with topologies

              suggestive of a role for introgression in spreading adaptive
              genetic variation. Demographic analysis showed that Acropora
              lineages profited from climate-driven mass extinctions in the
              Plio-Pleistocene, indicating that Acropora exploited ecological
              opportunity opened by a new climatic regime favoring species that
              could cope with rapid sea-level changes. Collectively, the
              genomes of reef-building corals have recorded an evolutionary

              individuals being inbred by estimating the 9 condensed Jacquard
              coefficients along with various other relatedness statistics. The
              program is threaded and scales linearly with the number of cores
              allocated to the process. CONCLUSION: The program is available as
              an open source C/C++ program under the GPL license and hosted at
              https://github.com/ANGSD/ngsRelate. To facilitate easy analysis,
              the program is able to work directly on the most commonly used
              container formats for raw sequence (BAM/CRAM) and summary data
              (VCF/BCF).",
